			<h2>About Craig</h2>
			<p class="p1">I remember at around the age of about 25 I looked in the mirror at a person that was severely underweight,
				an abuser to alcohol and cigarettes, always exhausted, anxious as hell, and had no self respect. I’d lived
				countless years completely unaware and unconscious of all of these things that would leave me trying to get
				through an extremely difficult (and probably short) lifespan.
			</p>
			<p class="p1">
				I started going for runs around my block with some music on and noticed it felt good,
				and liked the way I felt when I got back from my run. All my life I had issues with
				strength & confidence and could never put any weight on (even when the doctor
				advised that it was something I needed to seriously start doing for my health).
				I spent the next 12 months trying to get used to the new environment and build more confidence with my body but I was still
				doing everything wrong and wasn’t seeng any improvements in my weight gain or strength which was frustrating.
			</p>
			<p class="p1">
				This level of disappointment and frustration led me to start learning about the correct way to exercise and begin incorporating
				these methods on myself as my own experiment. This took a long time with a lot of failures and set backs along the way.
				The more I learnt, the smarter I got. The smarter I got, the stronger I got.

				As my interest grew, so did my commitment towards it, and I remember taking that next step in dedicating
				myself to learning as much as humanly possible staying up late into the early hours of the morning researching
				and studying it until I couldn’t keep my eyes open any longer. Today I live my healthy day to day life leading
				by example to my clients, close friends and family.

				My passion in physical and mental health is what drives me to help those in need who want to see improvements in
				their general health and well being. If theres one thing that I would change about my journey, it would be that I
				got real help from a coach or personal trainer when I was starting out in my first few years so that the process would
				have been much more productive, safer, and quicker!
