# Craig_Hunt_Coaching_FYP


The application was intended to enable for a personal trainer to manage their bookings and assign their clientele with their own respective fitness logs based on the information they supplied upon registration.

Having graduated, I no longer have access to the universities server and certain transactions with the database are no longer functioning as expected. Therefore, this project is currently a WIP until I am able to migrate it elsewhere in order to ensure that the application is working accordingly.

However, a user is still able to add exercses to their exercise log and view their exercise plan as well as their current bookings.

The sites administrator is also able to view their clients respective logs and add exercises to their plan in accordance with the clients progress. Furthermore, the sites administrator can still make modifications to their clients bookings inlcuding removing an appointment entirely. 

The projects optimal view is about 75% Zoom and functions best on either Edge or Chrome.
